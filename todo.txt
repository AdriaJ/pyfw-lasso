--------
Refactor
--------
* Do an example file with overwriting the rs_forward_op and compare wit the naive injection implementation.


----
Code
----
* Use a sparse implementation for the intermediate iterates.
    Different ways to do that:
        - use sparse.COO format (compatible with pycsou.LinOp ?)
        - use array of values and positions + a constructor that creates a non-dense array
        - use array of values and positions + adapt the forward operator so that it can be efficiently implemented for
        sparse inputs (chosen option)
    -> Needs to be tested in Notebook + finish example file
